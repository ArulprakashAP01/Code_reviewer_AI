# GitHub Security Scanner

## Overview
The GitHub Security Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed to scan code repositories for security vulnerabilities. It integrates with GitHub to automatically analyze code when pull requests are created or updated, and it generates detailed reports of any vulnerabilities found. These reports are then submitted as issues in the GitHub repository, allowing developers to address security concerns promptly.

## Features
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Utilizes various security scanning tools such as Bandit, ESLint, gosec, and Semgrep to identify vulnerabilities in code.
- **GitHub Integration**: Automatically creates issues in the GitHub repository with detailed vulnerability reports after scanning.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a summary of findings, including severity levels and recommendations for remediation.
- **Webhook Support**: Listens for GitHub webhook events to trigger scans based on pull request activity.
