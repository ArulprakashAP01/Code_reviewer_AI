# GitHub Code Review App

This project is a GitHub application designed to perform code reviews with a focus on identifying security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and path traversal attacks.

## Features

- **SQL Injection Detection**: Analyzes code for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by checking for unsafe query patterns.
- **XSS Detection**: Scans for potential cross-site scripting vulnerabilities by identifying unsafe user input handling.
- **Path Traversal Detection**: Checks for potential path traversal vulnerabilities by analyzing file access patterns.
- **Webhook Integration**: Processes incoming GitHub webhooks to trigger the appropriate analyzers based on the event type.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
