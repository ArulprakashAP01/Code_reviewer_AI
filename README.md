2024-01-15 10:30:15 - webhook - INFO - WEBHOOK EVENT: RECEIVED - PULL_REQUEST - OPENED
2024-01-15 10:30:16 - security - INFO - SECURITY SCAN STARTED - PR #123 - user/repo
2024-01-15 10:30:17 - scan - INFO - TOOL_EXECUTION - BANDIT - started
2024-01-15 10:30:20 - scan - INFO - TOOL_EXECUTION - BANDIT - completed
2024-01-15 10:30:25 - security - INFO - SECURITY SCAN COMPLETED - Issues: 5 (H:2 M:2 L:1)
```

### Log Viewer
Use the included log viewer for detailed monitoring:
```bash
# Show log summary
python log_viewer.py --summary

# Monitor recent activity
python log_viewer.py --recent 24

# Track specific PR
python log_viewer.py --pr 123

# Real-time monitoring
python log_viewer.py --monitor 300
```

## üîß Configuration

### Custom Security Rules
You can add custom security patterns by modifying the scanner:
```python
# Add custom patterns in _run_additional_checks method
custom_patterns = [
    (r'your_pattern', 'Your custom message'),
]
```

### Logging Configuration
Modify `logging_config.py` to adjust log levels and output:
```python
# Change log level
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Tool Configuration
Each security tool can be configured with custom rules:
```python
# Custom Bandit configuration
result = subprocess.run([
    "bandit", "-r", ".", "-f", "json", "-ll",
    "-c", "custom_bandit_config.yaml"
], capture_output=True, text=True)
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Systemd Service
```bash
# Install as system service
sudo cp security-reviewer.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable security-reviewer
sudo systemctl start security-reviewer
```

### Production Considerations
- Use HTTPS for webhook endpoints
- Implement proper authentication
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Configure backup and recovery
- Use environment variables for secrets

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Webhook not receiving events:**
- Check ngrok URL is correct and accessible
- Verify webhook secret matches
- Ensure app has proper permissions

**Scan not triggering:**
- Check app is installed on repository
- Verify PR events are subscribed
- Review console logs for errors

**Tools not working:**
- Install missing security tools
- Check tool versions and compatibility
- Review tool-specific error messages

**Authentication errors:**
- Verify GitHub App credentials
- Check private key format
- Ensure proper installation ID

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

### Health Check
Check application status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/health
```
